# Shop Trackee: Web App

## Background

In the contemporary business landscape, small enterprises encounter a significant barrier in establishing an online platform for their operations due to prohibitive costs associated with web development and maintenance. The high financial investment required often restricts their ability to tap into the potential of the digital marketplace, limiting their growth and outreach.

## Introduction

The "Shop Trackee: Web App" project aims to address a significant issue prevalent in the digital era, where small businesses such as service providers, mini stores, and repair shops struggle to establish an online presence due to cost constraints. In response to this, we propose the development of a Web Application Software that acts as a centralized platform for local businesses to connect with their local customer base.

## Solution

By leveraging this application, shopkeepers can extend their reach and increase their earnings by reaching more customers online. Customers, in turn, can easily access and purchase products or avail services from nearby local shops within their specified geographical proximity. The project integrates an image recognition service, allowing sellers to effortlessly add products or services by simply uploading images. On the customer side, this service facilitates image-based search, enhancing the user experience and streamlining the purchasing process.
